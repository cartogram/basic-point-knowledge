You have actually honed in on an interesting distinction that not many people think about. So ETFs have “shares” and mutual funds have “units”. Not sure that you need to know this, but it requires a little more detail.

Your position in an ETF could be quoted in either dollars or shares ex: 5 shares of VFV with a market price of $77.23 would have a market value of $386.15.

A mutual fund position could be quoted either way; units or current market value, your statement should list both.

One of the main differences between a mutual fund and an ETF is the structure. So an ETF is traded on an exchange and a mutual fund does not. Therefore you cannot trade fractional shares of an ETF. If you tried to invest \$1000 in the VFV ETF you would only be able to purchase 12 shares of the fund since you cannot buy 12.9483 shares of an ETF. However, a mutual fund is not traded on an exchange and consequently you can and should have fractional units listed on your mutual fund statement.

Shares and units are the most important thing to be tracked from an accounting perspective because the market price of an ETF share changes all the time as does the net asset value of a mutual fund and therefore the unit price of a mutual fund.

I will elaborate on the above statement by explaining that the market price of a share in an ETF is determined by the buying and selling of ETF shares and changes throughout the day, but a mutual fund unit price is only calculated once a day (at the end of trading 4pm). It is calculated by fist calculating the net asset value of the mutual fund (NAV) which is the end of day market price of all of the shares in the mutual fund multiplied by the number of shares owned of each company, then divided the NAV by the number of outstanding units (including fractional units in the mutual fund) to obtain a unit price for the mutual fund.

Example: a mutual fund only owns 10 shares of AAPL which has a market price of $318.73, would have a NAV of $3,187.3, say there were 5.64 outstanding units in the mutual fund, then the mutual fund price would be \$565.12

I imagine most mutual fund unit holders would rather look at the market value of their position instead of the fact that they have say 586.3421 units of the fund.

There is a little more detail involved, but I think this is probably sufficient to highlight the macro differences between the two structures.
