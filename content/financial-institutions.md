had seen an article in early Feb regarding the Wealthsimple cash card, probably brought it out to address the speed of transfer issues as you correctly pointed out below. The purpose of the below comparisons was to try to highlight the differences between traditional banks, discount brokerage accounts and robo-advisory accounts; with TD, Questrade, and Wealthsimple serving as a proxy for each. The issue with the comparison is that in the last few years the lines between these distinct business models is blurring. Questwealth Robo-advisory portfolios, Wealthsimple discount brokerage accounts, cash card etc.

I should have probably put the information below into a table or spreadsheet as it would have been easier to compare.

For the sake of providing complete information;

Questwealth portfolios (Robo-advising);

On balances \$100k or lower their fees are 0.25% vs. 0.5% at Wealthsimple. They also have 4 different “Risk” level portfolios (Aggressive, Growth, Balanced, Income, Conservative) vs. The three available at Wealthsimple (Growth, Balanced, Conservative)

Wealthsimple Discount Brokerage;
They state no commissions of any kind, I assume that would be for both ETFs and individual stocks. Questrade doesn’t charge for ETF trades, but does charge a flat commission of \$4.99 for stock trades.

I think you have two basic questions you need to ask yourself;

Do I want to go down the robo-advisory or discount brokerage route? On paper the most effective way to invest is using a discount brokerage account to directly buy the ETFs (or stocks) you want, since a robo-advisory account is just buying ETFs on your behalf automatically, using predetermed weightings (%), for a fee. However, the discount brokerage route does require more effort; as explained in the previous e-mail. So if you aren’t going to be willing/want to make the trades on a monthly or quarterly basis then the benefits of lower fees/more customizability will be negated by the lack of disciplined investing. Not sure if you are more or less on top of this than Fiona, but you should speak with Fiona as I have no idea how regularly she has been contributing/trading in her accounts. Also, I did tell her to switch the initial test purchases she made, in her individual margin account into a RRSP or TFSA brokerage account so that it would be tax sheltered, but not sure if she ever did that.

Ergonomics/ease of use; If you decide on a particular route let’s say discount brokerage, then you need to pick a platform; Wealthsimple or Questrade? Fees are certainly something to consider, but if you don’t like using the platform, or find it confusing then you will be less likely to be interested/want to use it. I personally never had any issues using Questrade, but I do know that Wealthsimple is targeted more towards the average person (layperson), where as Questrade (at least in the past) was more targeted towards do-it-yourself investors. I haven’t used the Wealthsimple brokerage platform, but I suspect it will be easier to use initially.
